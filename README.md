A cross-platform voice changer.

## Branch:

A Java CLI program that captures the audio from the microphone.

## Usage instructions:

1. Run it (easy).
2. It should capture audio automatically, check the console for the status messages.
3. Press enter to stop capturing.
4. Believe that it's working, as there's no playback ATM :-)
